# CLaSH_I-O
Two alternative designs for I/O implementation have been presented. First design
proves that we are able to read data from serial cable, the second design doesnâ€™t
read data properly. Boud rate of design maybe caused this or UART code works
differently because of the clock cycle. Following a complete UART sample on
VHDL or Verilog and apply the same solution over CLaSH would be more effective
solution for this problem.
